# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62) but without the responsive design and one of the first implementations of HTML+CSS for me.

Some sites/sources that I took help from:
Web Dev Simplified, W3school, freecodecamp
